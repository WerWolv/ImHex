/**
 * This is a simple forwarder that launches the main ImHex executable with the
 * same command line as the current process. The reason for this is that even
 * though ImHex is a GUI application in general, it also has a command line
 * interface that can be used to perform various tasks. The issue with this is
 * that kernel32 will automatically allocate a console for us which will float
 * around in the background if we launch ImHex from the explorer. This forwarder
 * will get rid of the console window if ImHex was launched from the explorer and
 * enables ANSI escape sequences if ImHex was launched from the command line.
 *
 * The main reason this is done in a separate executable is because we use FreeConsole()
 * to get rid of the console window. Due to bugs in older versions of Windows (Windows 10 and older)
 * this will also close the process's standard handles (stdin, stdout, stderr) in
 * a way that cannot be recovered from. This means that if we were to do this in the
 * main application, if any code would try to interact with these handles (duplicate them
 * or modify them in any way), the application would crash.
 *
 * None of this would be necessary if Windows had a third type of application (besides
 * console and GUI) that would act like a console application but would not allocate
 * a console window. This would allow us to have a single executable that would work
 * the same as on all other platforms. There are plans to add this to Windows in the
 * future, but it is not yet available. Also even if it was available, it would not
 * be available on older versions of Windows, so we would still need this forwarder
