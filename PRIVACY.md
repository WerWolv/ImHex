ImHex collects **anonymous** user statistics based on the user's preferences which are set on first launch and can be opted in or out at any moment through the settings interface.
These statistics contain basic system information such as: ImHex Version, System Architecture, OS, OS Version or Linux Distro version of the GPU in use. This information is linked to a randomly generated ID which cannot be used to identify a specific user.

Additionally, we allow uploading of anonymized crash log files in case of an error. These are never uploaded automatically but only after explicit consent by the user. This decision is not saved so logs can be uploaded on a per-error basis.

Information collected may be analyzed by members of our development team and will never be shared with third parties outside of the team. We may occasionally share general usage statistics publically in a summarized manner (For example a graph stating 70% of users are using a specific OS). We will never share information about individual users, even if they are anonymous.
