## Pattern Language

The Pattern Language is the completely custom programming language developed for ImHex.
It allows you to define structures and data types in a C-like syntax and then use them to parse and highlight a file's content.

- Source Code: [Link](https://github.com/WerWolv/PatternLanguage/)
- Documentation: [Link](https://imhex.werwolv.net/docs/)

## Database

For format patterns, libraries, magic and constant files, check out the [ImHex-Patterns](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns) repository. 

**Feel free to PR your own files there as well!**

## Requirements

To use ImHex, the following minimal system requirements need to be met:

- **OS**: Windows 7 or higher, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher, "Modern" Linux (Ubuntu 22.04, Fedora 36/37, RHEL/AlmaLinux 9, and Arch Linux have official packages, other and older distributions can use the AppImage)
- **CPU**: x86_64 (64 Bit)
- **GPU**: OpenGL 3.0 or higher 
  - Intel HD drivers are really buggy and often cause graphic artifacts
  - In case you don't have a GPU available, there are software rendered releases available for Windows and macOS
- **RAM**: 256MB, more may be required for more complicated analysis
- **Storage**: 100MB

## Installing

Information on how to install ImHex can be found in the [Install](/INSTALL.md) guide

## Compiling

To compile ImHex on any platform, GCC (or Clang) is required with a version that supports C++23 or higher. 
On macOS, Clang is also required to compile some ObjC code.
All releases are being built using latest available GCC.

Many dependencies are bundled into the repository using submodules so make sure to clone it using the `--recurse-submodules` option.
All dependencies that aren't bundled, can be installed using the dependency installer scripts found in the `/dist` folder.

For more information, check out the [Compiling](/dist/compiling) guide.
