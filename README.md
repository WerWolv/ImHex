## Pattern Language

The custom C-like Pattern Language developed and used by ImHex is easy to read, understand and learn. A guide with all features of the language can be found [in the wiki](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex/wiki/Pattern-Language-Guide) or a simpler version in ImHex under `Help -> Pattern Language Cheat Sheet`

## Additional Files

For format patterns, includable libraries and magic files, check out the [ImHex-Patterns](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Patterns) repository. Feel free to PR your own files there as well!

- Linux • __x86_64__
  - [ELF](https://nightly.link/WerWolv/ImHex/workflows/build/master/Linux%20ELF.zip)

## Compiling

You need a C++20 compatible compiler such as GCC 10.2.0 to compile ImHex. Moreover, the following dependencies are needed for compiling ImHex:

- GLFW3
- libmagic, libgnurx, libtre, libintl, libiconv
- libcrypto
- capstone
- nlohmann json
- Python3
- freetype2
- Brew (macOS only)

### Windows and Linux

Find all-in-one dependency installation scripts for Arch Linux, Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu and/or MSYS2 in [dist](dist).

After all the dependencies are installed, run the following commands to build ImHex:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```

---

To create a standalone zipfile on Windows, get the Python standard library (e.g. from https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib) and place the files and folders in `lib/python3.8` next to your built executable. Don't forget to also copy the `libpython3.8.dll` and `libwinpthread-1.dll` from your mingw setup next to the executable.

On both Windows and Linux:

- Copy the files from `python_libs` in the `lib` folder next to your built executable.
- Place your magic databases in the `magic` folder next to your built executable
- Place your patterns in the `pattern` folder next to your built executable
- Place your include pattern files in the `include` folder next to your built executable

### macOS

To build ImHex on macOS, run the following commands:

```sh
brew bundle --no-lock --file dist/Brewfile
mkdir build
cd build
CC=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang CXX=$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/clang++ PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib/pkgconfig":"$(brew --prefix)/lib/pkgconfig" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j
```
